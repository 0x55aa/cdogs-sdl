C-Dogs SDL 0.6.5 released, with a new campaign, new character editor, and some hitscan weapons!

## Harmful Crysalis

**Sauer2** is back with a cool new campaign, this one with very strong Alien Breed vibes!

## New Character Editor

There's a spiffy new character editor, powered by the awesome GUI library [**nuklear**](https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear), with extra previews!

## Hitscan Weapons

The C-Dogs collision code has been completely overhauled; now it uses [**Continuous Collision Detection**](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/q/55873/26250). In plain terms, it prevents fast-moving objects from tunnelling through each other, and makes it possible to implement **hitscan weapons**!

This might come with performance penalties though... next release we'll look at some performance optimisations.

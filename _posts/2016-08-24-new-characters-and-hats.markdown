Work continues on extracting the original graphics format to prepare for enhancements (like improved animations). Here's some early results enabled by that work:

These are extra character faces from Cyberdogs, now they can be played in C-Dogs SDL! But even the original C-Dogs faces have been enhanced; thanks to extra color keying work, we now have colorful shades, hats and more!

These changes will be part of the next release, look out for it soon!

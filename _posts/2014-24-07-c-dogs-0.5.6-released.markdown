This release has new and custom weapons, and autonomous co-op AI!

Some of the new weapons are shown in previous posts, and co-op AI is now able to help you complete mission objectives, as well as being a bit smarter than before.

C-Dogs SDL now supports custom weapons, defined as JSON files and loading per-campaign custom data. Take a look at `missions/techdemo/funwithguns.cdogscpn` for an example. Later I will document the file formats, and possibly provide a [weapon editor](https://github.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl/issues/276) - just nag me if you want it!

An update on the next version of C-Dogs SDL, which will have: level warp!

![level warp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl/gh-pages/_posts/levelwarp.gif)

Normally C-Dogs campaigns progress through a sequence of missions. Now, static maps can have:

- Multiple exits
- Each exit can progress to a different level

In the demo above, this is used to simulate travelling across different missions as if they were parts of the map. But more conventionally, level warp allows:

- Secret levels
- Branching paths

This opens up more interesting, story-driven campaigns. Stay tuned for more progress!

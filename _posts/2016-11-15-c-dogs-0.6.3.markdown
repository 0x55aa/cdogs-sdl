C-Dogs SDL 0.6.3 released; this version has some extra character faces, colors, and a cool new dogfight map by sauer2, *Temple of Carnage*:

And special thanks to *Vadim Barkov* for setting up automatic Windows and macOS deployment, which saves a ton of time on making releases.

The next version will probably contain more enhancements to the character sprites, all enabled thanks to *Ronny Wester's* generous release of C-Dogs assets as CC-BY. Stay tuned for more updates on that!

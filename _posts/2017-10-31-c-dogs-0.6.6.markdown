## HUD improvements

There's a bunch of HUD improvements in this release. Ammo notifications as covered in the last post, some text popups when you pick things up, showing a map in a second window, health gauge animations, and more! Thanks to new contributors [**Ottani**](https://github.com/Ottani) and [**davidrgmcb**](https://github.com/davidrgmcb) for some of these.

The [0.5.8 release](https://github.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl/releases/tag/0.5.8-1) includes deathmatch mode. Before this, C-Dogs had "dogfight" where you fight your friends in a first-to-5, multiple round game. With deathmatch, the action is non-stop! Keep your finger on the trigger; the action doesn't end until only one is left standing - or none at all!

Also included are a few maps specially designed for deathmatch, with weapon and ammo spawners spread around the map. These levels may seem familiar...

Each level also comes with devastating custom weapons!

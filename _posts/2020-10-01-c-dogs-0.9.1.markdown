C-Dogs SDL 0.9.1 released! This release fixes a few bugs that would spawn players inside locked rooms, making them unwinnable (unless you restart the level). Oops! ðŸ˜‚

Thanks to the people who reported bugs and contributed patches for this release - [@chack05](https://github.com/chack05), [@Wuzzy](https://github.com/Wuzzy2) and [@susnux](https://github.com/susnux) ðŸŽ‰

Happy October, and friendly reminder that [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) is happening!

And there's a load of more enhancements and fixes; find it all in the release notes!

## Broken Stuff

Sadly there's a few outstanding issues with the game. During this release there was a massive graphical refactor, and as a result there are still a few niggling issues, and the editor is pretty broken ðŸ˜¿ These will be fixed in future releases.

## Different Versioning

On an administrative note, we'll be changing the versioning system slightly. Previous releases tended to bump the patch version (e.g. 0.6.8 -> 0.6.9) but this doesn't quite make sense since lots of new features get added all the time. So the next release is slated to be **0.8**. Patch number will be bumped on fixes only. And if there happens to be major changes, we might finally go to **1.0** ðŸ˜±

Happy gaming! ðŸŽ‰

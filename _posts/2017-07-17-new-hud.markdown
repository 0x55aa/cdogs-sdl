Added some extra [ammo notifications](https://github.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl/issues/362) to the HUD, like flashing when low ammo:

Let's compare this to the classic C-Dogs HUD:

A lot of new stuff has been added since then. HUD improvements was one of the first enhancements added to C-Dogs SDL, with the [health bar](https://github.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl/issues/26) from way back in 2013. From there we've added:

- Reload bar
- Popup animations
- Heads (lives)
- Gun icon
- Optional cash/ammo instead of score
- Ammo gauge
- Gauge animations

And of course, the low ammo flash effect. Look out for the new HUD in the next release of C-Dogs SDL!

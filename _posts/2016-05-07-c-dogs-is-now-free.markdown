C-Dogs SDL is now completely free! All original data has been released as CC-BY 3.0.

I have contacted Ronny Wester, the original author, who agreed to do the release. Now C-Dogs SDL is 100% free and open!

Look out for version 0.6.1 soon; it has a load of bug fixes and some sweet new campaigns courtesy of [sauer2](https://github.com/sauer2)!

C-Dogs SDL 0.6.9 released! This release adds bullet trails to hitscan guns, as well as Superhot mode...

## Hitscan trails

Hitscan guns were added several releases ago, but one notable thing was missing... bullet trails! Well this release belatedly adds them and take a look:

## Superhot(tm) mode

Just for fun, we've added a new gameplay option. Just like its namesake, when enabled, time stops unless you are pressing a button.

The next release of C-Dogs SDL, version 0.6, is being delayed :(

An OS X bug with SDL image 1.2 means that it is unusable, as it creates corrupted images like this:

Which means the [port to SDL 2](https://github.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl/issues/169) has to be moved ahead, delaying the next release.

SDL 2 will be quite a significant upgrade for C-Dogs, providing speed and input enhancements, so it will be worth the wait!

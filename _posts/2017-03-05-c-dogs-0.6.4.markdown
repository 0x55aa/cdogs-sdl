C-Dogs SDL 0.6.4 released, and as promised, features a new walk animation!

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl/gh-pages/_posts/walk_cycles.gif)

If you're curious about the content pipeline for the spritesheet, there's a writeup [here](http://cxong.github.io/2017/03/3d-rendered-pixel-sprites).

There's a few other improvements too, like pickups randomly appearing after destroying map objects, with help from [*Christian Murphy*](https://blog.christiancod.es) a.k.a. *grimpunch*.

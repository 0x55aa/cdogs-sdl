C-Dogs SDL 0.5.6 introduced custom weapons, but apart from [a sample campaign](https://github.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl/tree/master/missions/techdemo/funwithguns.cdogscpn), the function was quite opaque.

Every weapon in C-Dogs SDL is made using the same way, so you can make fancy weapons like this booby trap:

It's been a while since the last update! The next release of C-Dogs SDL is still on the way, with lots of features. Here's a sneak peek: a new HUD redesign!

The old HUD was nice and minimal but as we've added features like ammo and grenades, it was getting a little cramped. This new HUD is much more condensed and with 90's pixel art stylin'. We hope you like it too!

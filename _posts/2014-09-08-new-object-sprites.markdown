Here are some new sprites for the "map objects" - static objects that you can blow up, old versus new:

These were mostly adapted from [various sprite packs](http://opengameart.org/content/c-dogs-sdl-replacement-art) from [OpenGameArt](http://opengameart.org). All the graphics in the game (including the [font](https://github.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl/issues/138)) will need to be replaced as unfortunately the original ones are not open source. [Once that's done](https://github.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl/issues/173) then C-Dogs can be 100% free!

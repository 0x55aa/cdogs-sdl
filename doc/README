| 1 | Introduction |
+---+--------------+

C-Dogs SDL is a port of a really fun old DOS game to modern operating systems,
using the SDL media libraries for graphics, sound and input (hence the name).

For more information about the original c-dogs read 'original_readme.txt'.


+---+---------------------+
| 2 | Tested Environments |
+---+---------------------+

C-Dogs SDL has been ported with a unix development environment.
In theory, C-Dogs SDL could run on any system that is supported by SDL.
See the SDL website - <www.libsdl.org> for more details on SDL itself.

Tested architecture/system combinations include:

Linux:			
	* x86		(gentoo, slackware, ubuntu)
	* x86-64	(gentoo)
	* ppc		(ubuntu)

Windows:
	* x86		(XP SP2) [ could be a little flaky ]

MacOSX:
	* ppc
	* x86		(reportedly works fine)

FreeBSD:
	* x86		(reportedly works fine)

OpenBSD:
	* x86		(reportedly works fine)

Should you succeed in running C-Dogs SDL on a different operating system,

| 3 | Installation |
+---+--------------+

To compile C-Dogs SDL you need to have the SDL libraries previously installed,
a compiler (gcc recommended) and the apropriate header files.

See /doc/INSTALL for actual installation instructions...


+---+----------------------+
| 4 | Command line options |
+---+----------------------+

The C-Dogs binary is called "cdogs". Below are some command line arguments:

Video Options:
	-fullscreen	Try and use a fullscreen video mode.
	-scale=n	Scale the window resolution up by a factor of n
			  Factors: 2, 3, 4
	-screen=WxH	Set virtual screen width to W x H
			Modes: 320x200, 320x240, 400x300, 640x480, 800x600
	-forcemode	Don't check video mode sanity

Sound Options:
	-nosound	Disable sound

Control Options:
	-nojoystick	Disable joystick(s)
	-js1threshold=n Joystick 1 threshold.
	-js2threshold=n Joystick 2 threshold.

Game Options:
	-savecampaigns  Save builtin campaigns as in the current directory.
	-wait		Wait for a key hit before initialising video.
	-shakemult=n	Screen shaking multiplier (0 = disable).

	-help		Display command line options and version information.

These can be used in any order/combination:
	$ cdogs -fullscreen -wait
Which will make it go full screen after all the pre-video stuff is displayed
on stdout.

| 1 | Introduction |
+---+--------------+

C-Dogs SDL is a port of a really fun old DOS game to modern operating systems,
using the SDL media libraries for graphics, sound and input (hence the name).

For more information about the original c-dogs read 'original_readme.txt'.


+---+---------------------+
| 2 | Tested Environments |
+---+---------------------+

C-Dogs SDL has been ported with a unix development environment.
In theory, C-Dogs SDL could run on any system that is supported by SDL.
See the SDL website - www.libsdl.org for more details on SDL itself.

Tested architecture/system combinations include:

Linux:			
	* x86		(gentoo, slackware, ubuntu)
	* x86-64	(gentoo)
	* ppc		(ubuntu)

MacOSX:
	* ppc
	* x86		(reportedly works fine)

FreeBSD:
	* x86		(reportedly works fine)

OpenBSD:
	* x86		(reportedly works fine)

Should you succeed in running CDogs-SDL on a different operating system,

| 3 | Installation |
+---+--------------+

To compile C-Dogs you need to have the SDL libraries previously installed,
a compiler (gcc recommended) and the apropriate header files.
These instructions assume you have the know-how to at least compile
something... :)

See INSTALL for more information...

| 4 | Command line options |
+---+----------------------+

The C-Dogs binary is called "cdogs", below are some command line arguments:

	-fullscreen	C-Dogs will try and become full screen (recommended)

	-nojoystick	C-Dogs will not use any available joysticks
	
	-wait		C-Dogs will wait for a key to be hit before 
			initialising graphics
	
	-nosound	C-Dogs won't play sounds, thus saving CPU usage and
			leaving your sound-card alone (if you have one)

	-scale=FACTOR	C-Dogs will scale the window by a factor (2, 3 or 4).

	-help		Display more command line options where are
			not listed here

These can be used in any order/combination:
	$ cdogs -fullscreen -wait
Which will make it go full screen after all the pre-video stuff is displayed
on stdout.

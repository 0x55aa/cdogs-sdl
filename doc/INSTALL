C-Dogs SDL Installation
=======================

Currently, C-Dogs SDL compiles nicely on Linux, Windows, *BSD and MacOSX.

For every platform, you will need the relevant SDL and the SDL development
packages installed, and optionally SDL_mixer (recommended).

Linux:
------

 1) Manually, edit the Makefile in /src
	- change SYSTEM to "linux"
	- set PREFIX, BINDIR, DATADIR
	- set CF_ARCH if you need architecture-specific optimisations
	- set I_AM_CONFIGURED to 1 when you're happy

 2) extract cdogs-data.tar.bz2 to /data:
 	$ mkdir cdogs-sdl/data
	$ cd cdogs-src/data
	$ tar --strip-path 1 -xjvf cdogs-data-current.tar.bz2

 3) finally:
	$ make cdogs
	$ sudo make install

MacOS X:
--------

 * Use the XCode project in /build/macosx/ (recommended)
 
 OR

 * Use the "Linux" method, but with "macosx" instead of "linux"

 Windows:
 --------
 
  1) Ensure you have Mingw32 and MSYS installed and configured correctly
 
  2) Use the "Linux" method, but with "mingw32" instead of "linux"
 
Other *Nixes:
-------------

 * Use "Linux" method, and pray!
